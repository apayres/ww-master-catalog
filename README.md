# Master Catalog

This fun little project is a web application used to manage the item catalog for my fictitious company, WookieeWare Systems. Items managed 
in this application can be assigned to clients (other fictitious companies using WWS services) which can be consumed by downstream applications.

This project was a personal challenge to use Vue 3's options API with .NET MVC. All-in-all, I have mixed feelings about 
Vue 3's options API. It is nice that there is no JS compiler needed, but it does feel a bit archaic. Nonetheless, this project was 
a lot of fun and I learned a lot. Which was the whole point ;)
